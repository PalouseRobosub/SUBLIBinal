# SUBLIBinal
An interrupt-based software library for PIC32 microcontrollers

This library was originally designed for use on our robotic submarine to speed up development and eliminate common bugs when dealing with the peripheral modules on our microcontrollers. We have released this library with the hope that others may find it useful.

It uses a lightweight interrupt-based architecture, taking advantage of the hardware peripheral modules in the PIC32 to be as efficient as possible.

It is designed specfically for use with the Microchip PIC32MX250F128B. Porting to other microcontrollers is possible, but we do not plan to expand support to other microcontrollers at this time.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/PalouseRobosub/SUBLIBinal/wiki) for documentation on how to use SUBLIBinal. to find code examples, please look in the [examples directory](https://github.com/PalouseRobosub/SUBLIBinal/tree/master/examples) for usage examples.
